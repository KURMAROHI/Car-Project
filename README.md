# HillClimb Clone Projcet
This is my first personal project, a Hill Climb Clone, where I explored Unity's physics system, Sprite Shape Controller, and terrain generation. Currently, the game features only one terrain and one vehicle, but I plan to expand it by adding more vehicles and terrains in the future.

This project showcases my understanding of:
 1)2D physics-based vehicle movement
 2)Procedural terrain generation
 3)Smooth camera movement
 4)Using JSON for storing and managing collected coins data
